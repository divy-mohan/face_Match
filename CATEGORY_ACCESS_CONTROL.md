# Category-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This implementation restricts supervisors to only register employees and mark attendance for job categories they are assigned to.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates
- Added `assigned_categories` field to `Supervisor` model as ManyToManyField to `JobCategory`
- Created migration `0008_supervisor_assigned_categories.py`

### 2. View Updates
- **supervisor_dashboard**: Filters employees by supervisor's assigned categories
- **register_employee**: Only shows job titles from assigned categories, validates category permission
- **mark_attendance**: Only allows attendance marking for employees in assigned categories

### 3. Admin Interface
- Enhanced `SupervisorAdmin` with category assignment interface
- Added `filter_horizontal` for easy category selection
- Display assigned categories in supervisor list

### 4. Error Handling
- Shows appropriate messages when supervisors have no assigned categories
- Prevents unauthorized access to employees outside assigned categories

## Usage

### Assigning Categories to Supervisors

#### Via Admin Interface:
1. Go to Django Admin â†’ Supervisors
2. Select a supervisor
3. Use the "Assigned categories" field to select categories
4. Save

#### Via Management Command:
```bash
python manage.py assign_categories <supervisor_id> <category_id1> <category_id2> ...
```

Example:
```bash
python manage.py assign_categories 1 2 3
```

### How It Works

1. **Employee Registration**: Supervisors can only register employees for job titles within their assigned categories
2. **Attendance Marking**: Supervisors can only mark attendance for employees whose job titles belong to their assigned categories
3. **Dashboard**: Only shows employees from assigned categories

### Security Features

- Category validation on both frontend and backend
- Database-level filtering prevents unauthorized access
- Clear error messages for permission violations
- Graceful handling of supervisors with no assigned categories

## Database Schema

```sql
-- New field added to core_supervisor table
ALTER TABLE core_supervisor ADD COLUMN assigned_categories_id;

-- Junction table created automatically by Django
CREATE TABLE core_supervisor_assigned_categories (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    supervisor_id INTEGER REFERENCES core_supervisor(id),
    jobcategory_id INTEGER REFERENCES core_jobcategory(id)
);
```

## Migration Required

Run the following command to apply the database changes:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing

1. Create job categories
2. Create supervisors
3. Assign categories to supervisors via admin
4. Test that supervisors can only:
   - Register employees for their assigned categories
   - Mark attendance for employees in their assigned categories
   - View employees from their assigned categories on dashboard
